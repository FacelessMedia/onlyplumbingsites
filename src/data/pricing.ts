    question: "What if I just want a website?",
    answer:
      "The one-time Website Build at $2,500 is perfect. You get a fully custom plumbing website with everything you need to start generating calls. If you want ongoing growth, you can always upgrade later.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the 12-month contract the best value?",
    answer:
      "A website alone won't rank. It's the ongoing SEO content, service area expansion, and optimization that drives calls month after month. The 12-month plan covers everything — site build plus a full year of growth work — for less than hiring an agency.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel the 12-month plan?",
    answer:
      "After month 6, you can cancel with 60 days notice. We want you to stay because it's working — not because you're locked in. Most clients see strong results by month 3-4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of ROI can I expect?",
    answer:
      "Most plumbing jobs net $300-$500+. You need just 2-3 extra jobs per month to cover the investment — and our clients typically see 15-30+ additional calls per month once their site and SEO are dialed in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with plumbing companies outside Illinois?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We serve plumbing companies nationwide. Local SEO strategy works the same whether you're in Chicago, Dallas, or Phoenix — it's about dominating YOUR service area.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes you different from other web designers?",
    answer:
      "I'm a licensed plumber. I've been in the trade since 2009. I understand emergency service dynamics, seasonal demand, dispatch workflow, and what makes a homeowner pick up the phone. Most designers don't.",
  },
