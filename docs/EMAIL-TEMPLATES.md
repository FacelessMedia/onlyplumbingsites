## 8. Post-Call Nurture (Day 3 — Case Study)

**Subject:** How a plumbing company went from 20 to 150+ calls/month

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Wanted to share a quick story that reminded me of our conversation.

One of our clients came to us getting about 20 calls a month from their website. Their site looked "fine" but had major conversion issues — no click-to-call buttons above the fold, no service area pages, and their Google Business Profile was barely optimized.

**Within 6 months:**
- Page 1 rankings for 15+ plumbing keywords
- Google Map Pack top 3 in their primary city
- 150+ inbound calls per month from organic search alone

The biggest unlock? It wasn't one thing. It was having a complete marketing system instead of random pieces.
