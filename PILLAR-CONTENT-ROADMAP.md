## Guide Template (for consistency)

Every pillar guide should include:

1. **Hero** — Title, subtitle, read time, "Written by a Licensed Plumber" badge
2. **Table of Contents** — Collapsible, linked to each section
3. **Introduction** — What this topic is, why it matters for plumbers specifically
4. **Deep content sections** — 8-15 sections per guide, 3,000-5,000+ words total
5. **Step-by-step instructions** — Numbered steps with screenshots/examples where possible
6. **Plumber-specific examples** — Not generic marketing advice, specifically for plumbing businesses
7. **Common mistakes** — What plumbers get wrong about this topic
8. **DIY vs Hire** — Honest breakdown of doing it yourself vs hiring someone
9. **Our service offering** — One-time or monthly service with pricing comparison to competitors
10. **FAQ section** — 8-12 questions with FAQPage schema for rich results
11. **Email capture CTA** — Offer a printable checklist/template related to the topic
12. **Tool CTA** — Link to related free tool (Website Grader, Citation Checker, etc.)
13. **Book a Call CTA** — Link to strategy session booking page
14. **Internal links** — Link to related guides, blog posts, and tools

## Content Rules

- **Depth over breadth** — Each guide should be THE definitive resource on the internet for that topic + plumbers
- **Honest** — If something is unnecessary, say so. If a competitor charges too much, explain why with data.
- **Practical** — Every section should have actionable steps the reader can take today
- **Plumber-specific** — Not "how to do SEO" but "how to do SEO when you're a plumber in Dallas"
- **Serve dual purpose** — Teach them how to do it (builds trust & authority) AND show them why hiring us makes sense
- **No fluff** — Every paragraph earns its place. No filler.
